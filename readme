The goal: create a virtual space where 
    Connections between: User-inputted data
    THE STORY is explained and elicited from users
    Related topics have proximity to one another

The goal: User-feedback defines visibility and access permissions
    : Self-governing, democratic votes of adjectives [[appropriate, insightful, helpful, key, foundationally true, etc.]]
    : Inappropriate comments or users can be reported and permissions adjusted based on community voting outcomes
    : Inappropriate users will be able to access only simplistic versions ("freemium") of THE STORY
    : If they ask the correct questions, add insight that is helpful, etc. they gain permissions, visibility, and ability to contribute to the NEW WORLD
